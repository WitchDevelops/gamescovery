# What I learned

1. How to set the URL query search params so that they show up in the url query string, while also filtering, sorting, and displaying some stuff on the screen. Some resources that were incredibly helpful:

- Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout
- this article: https://dev.to/ferdianarid/using-usesearchparams-in-nextjs-14-1737
- StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43862600/how-can-i-get-query-string-parameters-from-the-url-in-next-js
- and Mistral ;)

2. How to work with react-query. It has a number of benefits vs plain axios or useEffect hook. Such as: auto retries, auto refresh, caching.
